This repository includes the Python code for the task: Quantile regression prediction of residential electricity (power) demand in two locations Houston and Austin, Texas using two datasets:
- Historical weather data between (2015-2025),
- Electricty consumption (2015-2025) in residential sector in Texas.
The targeted consumers are socially vulnerable communities, whose power consumption is approximately 10% lower than the average.

The qunatile regression is implemented through a Sequence-to-Sequence RNN network equipped with Attention mechanism (Bahdanau Method). 
A description of the files in the repository is provided below.
